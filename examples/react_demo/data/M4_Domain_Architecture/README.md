**Task**
You are given five UniProt IDs. For each protein, identify all of its domains using Pfam annotations from UniProt. Your task is to find the single most common domain across all five proteins. Return the Pfam accession ID (e.g., 'PF00069') of this most common domain in the format <answer>str</answer>.

**Steps**
1) Create an empty list to store all Pfam IDs found.
2) For each UniProt ID in the input list, query the UniProt API for its JSON data.
3) Parse the 'dbReferences' section and filter for entries where 'type' is 'Pfam'.
4) For each Pfam entry found, add its 'id' to the list.
5) After processing all proteins, use Python's `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each Pfam ID in the list.
6) Find the most common Pfam ID from the counter.
7) Return this ID as a string.

**Variant**
We don't need to download the data, the data is already in variant_1 folder

['P04637', 'P63000', 'O15350', 'O15151', 'Q02750']
