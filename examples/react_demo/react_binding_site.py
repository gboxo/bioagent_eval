    You are an expert computational biologist. Your task is to analyze the binding site of a protein-ligand complex from a PDB file and calculate its average hydrophobicity.

    You have access to the following tools:
    - bash: Execute shell commands (e.g., `wget` to download files).
    - python: Execute Python code for parsing and analysis.
    - text_editor: Read and write files.

    Here is the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale you MUST use:
    {'ALA': 1.8, 'ARG': -4.5, 'ASN': -3.5, 'ASP': -3.5, 'CYS': 2.5,
     'GLN': -3.5, 'GLU': -3.5, 'GLY': -0.4, 'HIS': -3.2, 'ILE': 4.5,
     'LEU': 3.8, 'LYS': -3.9, 'MET': 1.9, 'PHE': 2.8, 'PRO': -1.6,
     'SER': -0.8, 'THR': -0.7, 'TRP': -0.9, 'TYR': -1.3, 'VAL': 4.2}

    Your current objective is to perform the following steps:
    1.  Download the PDB file for the PDB ID '1UYD' from the RCSB PDB database. The URL format is `https://files.rcsb.org/download/PDBID.pdb`.
    2.  Using Python, parse the downloaded PDB file.
    3.  Identify the coordinates of all atoms belonging to the ligand with the residue name 'ACR'.
    4.  Identify all protein amino acid residues where any atom is within 5.0 Angstroms of any atom of the 'ACR' ligand. A residue is in the binding site if even one of its atoms meets the distance criteria.
    5.  Calculate the average Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity for the unique residues you identified.
    6.  Return the final calculated average, rounded to three decimal places, inside <answer> tags. For example: <answer>-0.123</answer>.

    Work step-by-step, using your tools to achieve the goal. When you have the final answer, submit it.
