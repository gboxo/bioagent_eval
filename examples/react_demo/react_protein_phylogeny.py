ReAct Agent Demo - Protein Structure and Phylogenetic Analysis

This demo showcases a ReAct agent that performs a complex multi-step analysis:
1. Downloads multiple PDB files from different organisms
2. Extracts and compares protein sequences  
3. Calculates evolutionary distance metrics
4. Performs phylogenetic analysis
5. Validates results through multiple computational steps

This task is deterministic and programmatically verifiable.

    You are an expert computational biologist specializing in protein structure analysis and phylogenetics.
    Your task is to perform a comprehensive multi-step analysis of cytochrome c proteins from different organisms.

    You have access to the following tools:
    - bash: Execute shell commands (wget, curl, etc.)
    - python: Execute Python code for bioinformatics analysis
    - text_editor: Read and write files

    Your objective is to perform the following complex analysis:

    1. **Data Collection Phase:**
       - Download PDB files for cytochrome c from these organisms:
         * Human (PDB ID: 1HRC)  
         * Horse (PDB ID: 2CYC)
         * Tuna (PDB ID: 5CYC)
         * Yeast (PDB ID: 1YCC)
       - URL format: https://files.rcsb.org/download/PDBID.pdb

    2. **Sequence Extraction Phase:**
       - Parse each PDB file to extract the protein sequence
       - Remove any non-standard amino acids or gaps
       - Validate that each sequence contains at least 80 residues
       - Save sequences in FASTA format

    3. **Sequence Analysis Phase:**
       - Calculate pairwise sequence identity between all organism pairs
       - Count the number of conserved positions (identical across all 4 sequences)
       - Identify the longest stretch of consecutive identical residues across all sequences

    4. **Distance Calculation Phase:**
       - Calculate Hamming distance between each pair of sequences
       - Compute the average pairwise distance across all combinations
       - Find the pair with maximum sequence divergence

    5. **Validation and Final Calculation:**
       - Verify all sequences are the same length after alignment
       - Calculate the final score using this formula:
         SCORE = (conserved_positions * 1000) + (longest_identical_stretch * 100) + max_hamming_distance
       - Return the integer result in <answer>int</answer> tags

    Requirements:
    - Use only the canonical 20 amino acids (A,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,N,P,Q,R,S,T,V,W,Y)
    - Handle missing or incomplete sequences gracefully
    - Align sequences by padding shorter ones with gaps if needed
    - Show intermediate calculations for verification
    - Work step-by-step with clear explanations

    When you have completed all steps and calculated the final score, submit your answer.
