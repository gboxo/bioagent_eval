**Task**
For a given PDB structure, calculate a simplified 'clashscore'. A clash is defined as two non-bonded atoms being closer than 80% of the sum of their van der Waals (VdW) radii. You must count the total number of such clashing atom pairs in the structure. Return this total count as an integer in the format <answer>int</answer>.

**Steps**
1) Define a dictionary of VdW radii for relevant atom types (e.g., C: 1.7, N: 1.55, O: 1.52, S: 1.8).
2) Download and parse the PDB file.
3) Get a list of all atoms.
4) Use `Bio.PDB.NeighborSearch` to find all atom pairs within a 4.0 Ã… cutoff.
5) Initialize a clash counter to 0.
6) Iterate through the pairs. For each pair, check if they are bonded (e.g., in the same residue or adjacent residues in the polymer).
7) If they are not bonded, find their VdW radii from your dictionary, calculate the sum, and multiply by 0.8.
8) If the actual distance between the atoms is less than this threshold, increment the clash counter.
9) Return the final count.

We don't need to download the data, the data is already in variant_1 folder
