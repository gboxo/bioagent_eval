**Task**
Download an NMR ensemble PDB file, which contains multiple structural models. For each residue, you must calculate its Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) across all models, which measures its flexibility. After calculating per-residue RMSF values, find the most flexible contiguous region of 5 or more residues (defined by the highest average RMSF over the window). If multiple regions have identical maximum average RMSF values (ties), return all tied starting positions as a comma-separated string of integers, sorted in ascending order. If there is only one maximum region, return just that single residue number. Format: <answer>str</answer>.

**Steps**
1) Download and parse the PDB file, loading all models.
2) Use `Bio.PDB.Superimposer` to align all models to the first model based on their C-alpha atoms.
3) For each residue position, calculate the average C-alpha coordinate across all aligned models.
4) For each residue position, calculate the RMSF.
5) You now have a list of RMSF values, indexed by residue number.
6) Implement a sliding window of size 5. Move this window across the RMSF list, calculating the average RMSF within the window at each step.
7) Find all starting positions of windows that have the highest average RMSF. If there are ties (multiple windows with identical maximum values), collect all their starting positions.
8) Return the starting residue number(s). If multiple ties exist, return them as a comma-separated string sorted in ascending order.

**Variant**
We don't need to download the data, the data is already in variant_1 folder
