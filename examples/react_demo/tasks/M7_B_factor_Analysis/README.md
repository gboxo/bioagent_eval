**Task**
Download a PDB file and analyze the flexibility of its residues. Extract the B-factor for every C-alpha atom in the structure. Identify all residues whose C-alpha B-factors are in the top 10% of all C-alpha B-factors for that structure. Return the average B-factor of these top 10% residues as a float rounded to two decimal places in the format <answer>float</answer>.

**Steps**
1) Download and parse the PDB file using Biopython.
2) Create a list and populate it with the B-factor of every C-alpha atom found in the structure.
3) Sort the list of B-factors in descending order.
4) Calculate how many residues constitute the top 10% (i.e., `k = int(len(b_factor_list) * 0.1)`, with a minimum of 1).
5) Take the top `k` B-factors, compute their arithmetic mean, round to two decimal places, and return this average as a float. Format: `<answer>float</answer>`.
